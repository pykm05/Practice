Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
None of the predictions proved incorrect as I incrased the number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 100000 simulationns I would call the predictions good enough.
